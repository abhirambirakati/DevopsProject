\# Git Bash \& GitHub Hands-On Project



\## Project Title

Disk Scheduling Simulator using Git Bash and GitHub



\## Course

Version Control Systems



\## Introduction

This project demonstrates practical usage of Git Bash and GitHub for version control.

A Python-based Disk Scheduling Simulator was used to perform Git operations such as

repository initialization, branching, merging, conflict resolution, and remote synchronization.



\## Project Structure

\- src/ : Python source files

\- data/ : Data files (if any)

\- docs/ : Documentation

\- screenshots/ : Git command and result screenshots



\## Technologies Used

\- Python

\- Git Bash

\- GitHub



\## Git Operations Performed

\- git clone

\- git status

\- git add

\- git commit

\- git branch

\- git checkout

\- git merge

\- git push



\## Branches Created

\- main

\- feature

\- test

\- bugfix

\- experiment



\## Merge Conflict Handling

A merge conflict was intentionally created between branches.

The conflict was resolved manually by editing the conflicted file and committing the resolution.



\## Challenges Faced

\- Understanding branch behavior

\- Handling merge conflicts

\- Resolving network issues during push



\## Conclusion

This project helped in understanding real-world Git workflows, including branching,

merging, conflict resolution, and collaboration using GitHub.
