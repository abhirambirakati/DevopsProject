# 🧠 Disk Scheduling Simulator (Version Control Systems – Git Bash & GitHub Project)

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a Git-centric university assignment developed as part of the **Version Control Systems** course.  
The main objective of the project is to demonstrate **practical usage of Git and GitHub** through a structured and disciplined version control workflow.

A Python-based **Disk Scheduling Simulator** was developed as the application layer to clearly showcase:

- Incremental development using commits
- Feature isolation using multiple branches
- Branching and merging workflows
- Intentional merge conflict creation and resolution
- Proper project documentation using Markdown

The primary focus of evaluation is **version control practices**, not the complexity of the application logic.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Git Bash – Local version control operations
- GitHub – Remote repository and branch management
- Python – Disk scheduling application implementation
- Markdown – Project documentation (README.md)

## 🌿 Git Workflow Used

The project follows a **branch-based Git workflow**:

- The `main` branch contains stable and final project code
- Separate branches were created for feature development, testing, bug fixing, and experimentation
- Each branch was worked on independently and later merged into `main`
- All changes were committed with meaningful messages before pushing to GitHub

This workflow ensures clean code history, better tracking of changes, and controlled integration.

## 🔀 Branches Created

The following branches were created and used in the project:

- `feature` – For feature-related changes
- `test` – For testing-related updates
- `bugfix` – For fixing issues
- `experiment` – For experimental changes

Each branch served a specific purpose and helped in isolating changes during development.

## 🧾 Git Operations Performed

The following Git operations were performed throughout the project:

- Repository cloning using `git clone`
- Checking repository status using `git status`
- Staging changes using `git add`
- Creating meaningful commits using `git commit`
- Creating and switching branches using `git branch` and `git checkout`
- Merging branches using `git merge`
- Demonstrating and resolving a real merge conflict manually
- Pushing code to GitHub using `git push`
